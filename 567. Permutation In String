        Explanation :
        This code is solving the "Permutation in String" problem (from Leetcode). You're given two strings, s1 and s2, and you need to check if a permutation of s1 exists as a substring in s2.

Let’s walk through the code step-by-step with explanation:

🔍 Objective:
Check if s2 contains a substring which is a permutation of s1.

A permutation means rearranged letters — so both strings must have the same character counts, just possibly in different order.

✅ Step 1: Early Return if Impossible
python
Copy code
if len(s1) > len(s2):
    return False
If s1 is longer than s2, there's no way a permutation of s1 could fit inside s2, so return False immediately.

🧮 Step 2: Initialize Frequency Counts
python
Copy code
s1Count, s2Count = [0] * 26, [0] * 26
for i in range(len(s1)):
    s1Count[ord(s1[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
    s2Count[ord(s2[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
Create two frequency arrays of size 26 (for each lowercase alphabet letter).

s1Count counts characters in s1.

s2Count counts the first len(s1) characters in s2 — this is our initial sliding window.

🎯 Step 3: Count Initial Matches
python
Copy code
matches = 0
for i in range(26):
    matches += (1 if s1Count[i] == s2Count[i] else 0)
We count how many characters have the same frequency in s1Count and s2Count.

If all 26 characters match, s2 contains a permutation of s1.

🔁 Step 4: Slide the Window
python
Copy code
l = 0
for r in range(len(s1), len(s2)):
    if matches == 26:
        return True
Start sliding a window of size len(s1) from left to right.

At each step, remove the leftmost character and add the rightmost one.

Add New Character to Window
python
Copy code
index = ord(s2[r]) - ord('a')
s2Count[index] += 1
if s1Count[index] == s2Count[index]:
    matches += 1
elif s1Count[index] + 1 == s2Count[index]:
    matches -= 1
We update the frequency for the new right character.

Then we check if it makes s1Count and s2Count match better or worse.

Remove Left Character from Window
python
Copy code
index = ord(s2[l]) - ord('a')
s2Count[index] -= 1
if s1Count[index] == s2Count[index]:
    matches += 1
elif s1Count[index] - 1 == s2Count[index]:
    matches -= 1
l += 1
Update the frequency for the character we slid out.

Adjust the matches count accordingly.

🧪 Final Check
python
Copy code
return matches == 26
After sliding through the entire string, return True if all 26 character frequencies matched at any point.

📌 Time & Space Complexity:
Time: O(N), where N = len(s2)

Space: O(1), since arrays are fixed size 26

🧠 Summary
The code uses:

Sliding Window of size len(s1)

Two frequency arrays to count characters

A matches counter to avoid comparing all characters every time

This is a very efficient solution!
